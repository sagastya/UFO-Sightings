# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## UFO Sightings

The purpose of this project is to create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided and allow users to filter table data for specific values. Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) eye-witness reports are in the dataset. Build the webpage using pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and D3.js There are 2 levels in the scope of this project:
#### Level 1: Automatic Table and Data Search
Create a basic HTML web page that appends a table and adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. The table has columns for date, city, state, country, shape and comments. Use a date form in HTML document and add a JavaScript event listener to read user input date and search for a match in the data.  
#### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories
Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns add an event listener to read user input multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on table columns:
  1. data
  2. city
  3. state
  4. country
  5. shape
